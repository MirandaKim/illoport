  <p>You are seeing his file because you ran a clean-slate gulp task.</br>
  <strong>If this was by mistake</strong>, check the folder ~/.trashed for what was here and swap it back into ~/src/assets.</br>
  If this was your intent, then delete this message and start working. Your working css and js are under ~/src/assets</p>
  <p>For more information on the clean-slate tasks, go to <b>~/gulp/clean-slate/README.md</b></p>
  <p>P.S. Don't forget to give this site a title, meta data, a favicon, and your own logo.</p>
