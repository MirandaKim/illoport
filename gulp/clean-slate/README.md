# CLEAN-SLATE TASKS

**CAUTION**: THESE ARE DANGEROUS TASKS
         READ BELOW FOR MORE DETAILS

**REMEMBER**: ALWAYS BACK UP YOUR WORK!

***

This directory contains the tasks for *OVERRIDING* the existing project src content,
and replaces them with template/quick-start files.
Use theses tasks one time before starting your site from these files.

***

## Why Have These Tasks?

  This repository hopes to give you a starting point of a site with gulp tasks for processing and an established file structure. But you may have noticed there is already a fair bit of html and styles, which you probably don't want cluttering up your site. In lieu of cleaning out this content yourself, these clean-slate tasks are provided to help you out.

***

## Task Summaries
_See "Available clean-slate task" for the actual task commands._

  - The **Clean** task give you a good starting point with elements and selectors you can customize. Some styles including globals, mixins, general modifiers, and variables are left in place. For html, index.html has some useful tags with class names to make starting out easier. Use this task if you want to have some basic structure when starting out.

  - The **Bare** tasks give you the bare bones that you then can fill in as you wish. Most of the styles file structure is left in place with class names, but very few contain styles (some mixins and variables are included, mainly for media queries). For html, the index.html file is left with the bare minimum tags. Use this task if you're just here for the pre-made gulp tasks and want to make your own structure.

  - The **Full** tasks give you the initial starting point of this repository (aka the html and styles that are available when the repository was first downloaded) for whatever reason you might like it.

  - Other options:
      - If you want to establish your own style structure, I suggest forgoing these tasks and manually deleting ~/src/assets/styles/base and ~/src/assets/styles/modules then modifying the contents of
      - If you want to adjust the html manually, go to ~/src/index.html and modify the contents yourself.
      - If you want to start by using all the styles and html initially available, go for it and ignore these tasks.
      - If forgoing these clean-slate tasks, you should go ahead and delete the import statement for the clean-slate index in gulpfile.js (See "Delete The Clean-Slate Logic After Use").

## RAN ONE OF THESE TASKS BY MISTAKE?

For your safety, these task will attempt to move the existing files to a new directory at the root (~/.trashed)

There is no task to delete the trash directory (~/.trashed). You can delete it manually when you're 100% sure nothing important will be lost.

***

## Delete The Clean-Slate Logic After Use

I strongly suggest you DELETE the clean-slate logic once you start customizing your assets to avoid loosing any work:
  - Remove the clean-slate import lines from ~/gulpfile.js
  - Delete this directory (~/gulp/clean-slate)
